        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LOS ANGELES &#151; There's no danger Penny Robinson will be confused with Claudia Salinger.<BR>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I'd been trying to find something that's different from Claudia, which people see me doing every Wednesday night,&quot; says Lacey Chabert, who plays Claudia on the Fox hit &quot;Party of Five&quot; and Penny in the new film &quot;Lost in Space.&quot;<BR>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;This came along, and I loved the character.&quot;<BR>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lacey, 15, was overjoyed to play someone unlike Claudia, the paragon of maturity and talent.<BR>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It's much more interesting to play a character who doesn't exactly have it all together than someone who does,&quot; she says.<BR>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Lost in Space,&quot; which knocked &quot;Titanic&quot; out of the No. 1 spot at the box office last weekend, has Penny traveling with her family across the galaxy. They're supposed to begin colonizing a planet, but an act of terrorism causes the Robinsons, their pilot, Maj. Don West (Matt LeBlanc), and the saboteur to enter uncharted space.<BR>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The film is based on the 1960s television show, but it's more serious and realistic&#151;and far less campy&#151;than the series. When Lacey plays Penny, her gothic-style makeup, accessories and tresses make the petite, dark-haired actress look more like her &quot;Party of Five&quot; co-star Neve Campbell than herself. She enjoyed helping create her new look.<BR>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The challenge was &quot;OK, what would this rebellious style be like in 50 years? Yet you sort of had to have a touch of something that people could relate to today and that didn't look totally alien,&quot; she says, meeting reporters at the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills.<BR>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I loved it. I got to get this different haircut, and these clothes were kind off of the wall. It was fun to do. Every day going to the set it was: How far are we gonna take it?&quot;<BR>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lacey has come a long way from her hometown of Purvis, Miss. She caught her first break when she was 8, winning three times singing on &quot;Star Search.&quot;<BR>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During a family vacation to New York, she did some auditions, including one for the Broadway production of &quot;Les Miserables.&quot; She won the role of the young Cosette, whom she played for 2&#189; years. During that time, she also played Binaca on &quot;All My Children.&quot;<BR>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just when her parents were about to move her back home, she got the job on &quot;Party of Five,&quot; which turned into a surprise hit.<BR>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;We thought we were going to get canceled after the third show,&quot; says Lacey. &quot;It didn't do that great at first. It would never pick up an audience, though critics were saying great things about it. I think Fox gave it time, and it finally clicked on somehow.&quot;<BR>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lacey, who's committed to two more seasons&#151;and a possible two sequels to &quot;Lost in Space&quot;&#151;believes viewers relate to &quot;Party&quot; because it's &quot;fresh and real.&quot;<BR>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It's problems that people have to deal with in real life,&quot; she says.<BR>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lacey's family has relocated to Los Angeles to accommodate her work, and that helps her stay grounded. But reel life can be disconcerting.<BR>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The hardest thing was &quot;probably the first kiss. It was three years ago, and it <EM>was</EM> my first kiss&#151;totally embarrassing.&quot;<BR>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But acting has its rewards, not the least of which was co-starring with &quot;Friends&quot; hunk LeBlanc.<BR>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Matt was a sweetie,&quot; says Lacey. &quot;Very cute. Had to have a crush on him in the film. Wasn't that hard. We called each other Sunflower. I wrote analogies, for studying my script, and one was for Penny being crippled and then running through a field of sunflowers, which is what I thought about that scene.<BR>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;And he got a hold of my script, and he wrote 'with Don West'&#151;'running through a field of sunflowers with Don West.' So embarrassed. On the day that we wrapped, he gave me, like, this huge, beautiful sunflower.&quot;
