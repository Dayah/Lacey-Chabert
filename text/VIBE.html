         <DD>Please say hello to the very talented and lovely Lacey Chabert.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>[Enters]</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>You look cute!</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Thank you.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>You got a little haircut?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>A little haircut. Did a little movie.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Uh huh. What movie was this?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Lost in Space.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Oh! You guys all remember Lost in Space? You guys did a remake of Lost in Space?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Yes, we did a remake of Lost in Space. Filmed it in London for 4 months.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Excuse me!</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>That's where I got the shoes. Kinda stole 'em. I mean, I didn't steal 'em but they just kinda happen&#151;</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Your character stole 'em.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Yeah, my character stole 'em and they happened to show up in my suitcase. You know, I'll give 'em back in the sequel.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>So was it fun?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Yeah, it was really great.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Good, good, good. Now, what about Claudia, our favorite TV personality on the show? Is there any new changes for her besides the cut?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Well, Claudia, you know, she's trying to have a new image&#151;have a little, you know, trendiness to her. And she's going to high school, and so she's trying out for the cheerleading squad hoping that she'll be, you know, the head mas&#151;the head cheerleader and umm, she goes with great expectations to find out that she's the mascot, a possum!</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>A possum?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>A possum. So I get to walk around in a possum costume for three episodes.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Is it hot?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>It's very hot! Yeah, it's not even a cute mascot.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Actually we have a picture of it. Could we show the picture of her in the little possum?</DD>
         <P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>[Clip Plays]</STRONG></P>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Wow, you're always doing different things on the show. That's what we like about your character. You even kissed a guy.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>I had to have my first kiss in front of, like, a hundred people.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>That was your first kiss?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>It was my first kiss, yeah. I didn't know what to do. So my sisters told me to, like, practice on a pillow, you know? But it didn't kiss me back so I didn't know what to expect. But it was good practice I guess.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Uh huh. Did you uhh&#151;did you ever have to like&#151;did you go to anybody else for practice?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Well, no.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Like uh, you know, friends in your neighborhood?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Yeah, I just knocked on their doors, &quot;Hey! Wanna kiss?&quot;</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>&quot;Hey, come on! I gotta kiss for money! Come on! Somebody have a kiss for free!&quot; So, umm, tell me uh&#151;tell me uh, what is, umm, making your character drive so hard who she is? I mean, you're a 14-year-old girl but your character has so much, so many dimensions. Where does that come from?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Well for me, to have to do stuff like that, you have to play, you know, emotional scenes. I mean the only way I can be there and really get into the character is if I'm her. You know?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Is she really close to who you are for real?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Uh, I think we're pretty different. I think, umm you know, Claudia not having parents is not very grounded at sometimes and she takes on more responsibility than she should have to. So I think we're different in that way. And, you know, I do have really great family.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Now, you have a boyfriend?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Ahem! Umm&#151;</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Oh, am I getting too personal? I'm sorry&#151;</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>No, no. I DO. Actually, when I was in [London], I had a little European romance&#151;</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>What's his name?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Alexander. When I was in London&#151;</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>You had a little English boy?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>He's actually not English.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Oh, okay.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>He lives in New York though. Like, long distance.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Oh, that long distance stuff, yeah.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>But umm, and I had my first kiss and everything.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Is he an actor too?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>No, he's not but he's actually the SON of an actor. But I can't say who he is, you know.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Sure! Tell us!</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Oh! No! No! No!</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>So tell us about Lost in Space.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Well, Lost in Space is just like, you know, the old show was except much more serious and you know, Gary Oldman and William Hurt are in it. It was amazing working with them and it was so much fun and it was so different from Part of Five, you know. We'd be staring out at green screens, watching things explode and, you know, on a spaceship. And so it was fun.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>A lot of special effects?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Tons of special effects! It's supposed to, like, make special effects history. I think.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Are you into special effects? Did you see like Terminator 2 and like, uh, what's the new movie, Spawn?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>I haven't seen that yet but I want to. Yeah, I had to deal with this little yellow lizard-monkey called Blarp.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>What's his name?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Blarp.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Blarp?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>That's his name right now. It might change.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Uh huh. When I was younger, we had a&#151; it was an episode of a&#151; it was a show called, uh, it was Lost in Space? Remember the show with Jim Neighbors? Dorse? My Favorite Martian?! He was like half dog, half horse? Y'all don't remember? Am I the&#151;am I the oldest one here? Alright, forget y'all! So you're from where now?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>I'm from Mississippi. And my dad is French Cajun. He's from Louisiana.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Can you do an accent? Can you talk like a French Cajun?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>I'm not very good with the accent but I like the food. The food is good.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>The food is jammin'. Vivica [Fox] was talkin' about that soul food stuff. She likes that food too.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Yeah, I want to open up a Cajun food restaurant, you know, called Chabert's.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Chabert's Soul Food!</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Yeah, exactly. True Cajun cuisine. You're all invited!</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Sinbad</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>You all may come down! Well, thank you for coming down to the show to be with us.</DD>
