         <DD>Lacey Chabert plays the younger sister, Claudia Salinger, on the critically-acclaimed Fox series &quot;Party of Five.&quot; She will also be seen in the upcoming motion picture &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot; from MGM. Lacey, welcome to AOL!</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Welcome Lacey!</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Hi guys, thanks for coming on. How is everybody doin'?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>We are ready to start with questions from our audience.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Okay.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Robert has the first one:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>What projects are you currently working on?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Well, I am about to do a TV movie in Toronto, a lot of voice work too. Anastasia and the Lion King II, stuff like that. I had a great time doing the Lion King II. That's about it for now.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>The next question comes from Stofffie:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Do you all get along off camera?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>I know it sounds really lame and everyone say it but&#133;we love each other&#133;who wouldn't like working with the 2 hottest guys? We are like family we do stuff off the set and have fun. Scott and I are always playing jokes on each other and other people it's fun.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Auditions has the next question:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Lacey, how has Broadway Kids been going?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Wow&#133;to tell the truth I am not really sure, I haven't been doing much with them lately.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>The next question is from Kelli2437:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Lacey I think you are great on Party of Five, are you anything like your character Claudia?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>I hope when it comes to the bratty side I am NOT. I think I am a little more grounded than Claudia. Claudia feels she has an answer for everything and if they listened to her everything would be OK!</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Lauren570 is asking:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Lacey, I am your biggest fan! What's it like being on TV?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>It's GREAT!! I love it. I feel really lucky that my parents let me do this I know a lot of kids dream of this and we have an incredible wonderful cast and we have a lot of fun!!</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>StvHerber wants to know:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Tell us about your work as a columnist for 16 magazine. What have some of the highlights and memorable moments been?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>I love writing the column. I love being a journalist and relating to the kids, I get a lot of mail and interesting questions. I like to interact with the kids. I got this love letter from a boy practically proposing to me, it was so sweet&#133;But my Dad says I can't date until I'm 42 so that was out of the questions. One of the great things I get is fan mail from kids who have lost their parents and I have helped them through it. One of the great things about acting is that I am able to touch some of these people it is really a nice part of acting.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>The next question comes from Kelli2437:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>How is it like to work with Scott Wolf and Matthew Fox?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Who wouldn't like working with the 2 cutest guys in the world? It's too bad they are older than me&#133;and 1 of them is married! They are the sweetest guys and they protect me like I'm their little sister!</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>XPanda123 is asking if:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Do you really play the violin?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>This is the hardest question to answer, I have played for 3 and a half years it was a coincidence that Claudia did too. I do actually have to learn the fingering and bowing. But because of sound reasons they have me play a muted violin so the sound doesn't get too much. So, Yes and NO&#133;it is not actually my sound but yes I am playing it! They dub in the sound later.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Sleeper80 is wondering:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>If you could go out with any actor your age, who would it be and why?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Ha ha ha MY age? Does he have to be my age? I only date younger men so nobody &quot;my age&quot;! ha ha ha!</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Lauren570 is asking:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Do your friends treat you differently because your on TV?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>No. I hate it when people treat me like a star&#133;I don't think I am. Having friends and family time is very important to me. I am a normal person who does something not normal.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>The next question comes from Jane432:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Who is your favorite person to work with on Party of Five, and why?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>I have a different relationship with them. Scott and I are like the jokesters and partners. Matthew treats me like my big brother, he helps me out on the set. And Neve is like my big sister on the set. So my relationship is different with them all&#133;I love them all!</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>JReader615 is wondering:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Where is your character going next season?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Tell you the truth I have no idea. I was asking the writers that the other day and I don't think they know. We saw her go back to her violin and grow up a little maybe she'll get a boyfriend! A cute one, not that the others have been not cute!</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>The next question comes from PeaceM12:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Lacey, you started out as an actress involved in theater. Do you have any advice for budding actors about auditions, acting, and &quot;hittin' it big?&quot;</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Having fun is the main thing. Being yourself. It is hard to tell someone how to act. When I play Claudia I have to become her, I have to reach down and find her. I think everyone has that inside them. As for someone trying to get into it, look at every audition you don't get is a learning experience, I went on a million auditions and sometimes the no's lead to a YES!</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Puffin12 is asking:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Is Lion King II going to be like the Return of Jafar, made for video? Or full feature?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>It is a made for video film. It will be a lot of fun!</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>JadeKryst is wondering:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Do you enjoy going online to talk to us people?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>I love talking to people. You hear opinions about you through the newspapers and all, I like talking to the real people. Thank you all very much for taking the time to talk to me.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>NorthStar would like to know:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>I realize this was a while back&#133;but can you tell us about your experiences with Les Miserables?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>It was incredible! There is nothing like performing in front of 1600 people a night live! I was understudy for a boy's part Devrosh and on my birthday they were both sick so I got to do it! I got shot 3 times and had a GREAT time! And at the end when I bowed I took off my hat and some people were like &quot;Oh my God&#133;it's a girl!&quot; It was one of the most exciting things I ever got to do!</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>

         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>When are you doing another talk show?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>I'm not sure exactly. I had a great time doing the Jay Leno show he was really nice!</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>

         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>What hobbies do you enjoy most?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>I love to golf!! It sounds weird but my brother and Dad golf and I always rode in the cart and 1 day I wanted to try and Dad bought me some clubs and I don't hit it very well only like 70 yards and all but it is something fun I can do with my brother and Dad.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Squintsbb is asking:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Who's been the best person you've worked with in a movie/TV show?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Wow. Let's see&#133;I had a great time working with Bette Midler in Gypsy, she was so nice, she was so much fun to be with. She would bring her dog Puddles on the set, she was called puddles because if you spoke to her in a high voice she peed. Bette was crazy and fun!</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Sammie518 is asking:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>What do you do as far as school is concerned?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>I have a tutor on the set. Because I am a child I can only work 9 and a half hours a day and 3 hours of that is school. It is really hard sometimes because I might be in the middle of a math test then have to go film a scene. One on one teaching is cool 'cuz I can go at my own pace!</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Sleeper80 wants to know:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Who did you hang out with during the awards at the Nick's Kid Choice Awards last week?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>That was so much fun, great atmosphere and all! I hung out with James Cromwell because I presented with him. I loved Babe and he was so nice and he was so tall, truly one of the nicest people I have met.</DD>

         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Lacey, what would you like to see happen to your character in the third season?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>See her get a boyfriend Ha ha ha. She is at an age when a lot of things happen. Sometimes it is hard to grow up in front of 15 million people, but she was kind of hard to deal with earlier and now she is back to playing the violin and I think that that is who she is.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>JamMo44 is wondering:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>

         <DD>CK 0000 is asking:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Did you have fun making the movie Babes in Toyland?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>I had a great time. I played Jill and I love doing animation, you get to be people you are not. I had a really fun time and I got to sing a song in it and it was a really fun time!</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>

         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Lacey, is it weird for you to see yourself on TV and be recognized by everyone?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Yeah, it is kind of weird and weird when people see you as a stranger and know your name. A trip to the mall is definitely not the same. I have tried the hat and glasses thing. I was in Hawaii and I was recognized there too. At the same time it is fun talking to people and being recognized it shows that people care about the show and the characters.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Sammie518 is asking:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Do you have friends not on TV? What is it like hanging out with them? Can you do normal stuff?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>I am normal, I have responsibilities around the house and all. We just moved to a residential neighborhood. Some people want to be more of a fan than a friend but most people treat me normal which is good because I AM normal.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Papuk10 is asking:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Lacey, do you have a movie in the works?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>I really wanted to get into features this summer and some stuff came out but nothing worked out with the timing and Party of Five. I am starting work next week on a TV movie it's called Mother's Day. I play an adopted girl&#133;it is really a mystery movie.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>The next question comes from MRubens56:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Are you planning to do any other things in acting in the future?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>I definitely want to continue this forever! When I get a little older I would love to go into directing. I asked to direct an episode of Party Of Five this season but they said no. Directing is very interesting to me.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>The next question is from Jennyann7:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>When will Party of Five be back on, with new episodes?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>We start filming in June and they'll start airing probably around the end of July. I am not sure of the exact date yet.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>The next question is from Imagers1:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>You're quite a good actress, Cosette AND Gavroche! Great on Po5 too. Your character is often the most mature of the bunch. Sometimes Claudia seems too adult though the scenes with Charlie are especially good. Do you feel the character is too adult?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Thank you very much for the complements. Claudia feels she has to take on more responsibility than girls her age. She has to grow up too fast, she worries about her other siblings, she feels that nobody is really responsible for her even though Charlie is. But she has been forced to grow up a little faster.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>AOLiveMC8</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Phreaignc is asking:</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Do you answer all of your fan mail personally? If so, how do we reach you (and other Po5 actors)?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>LaceyC</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Yes I do actually. I try to answer all of it. Me and my Mom address them all and my sisters help too. Most of my mail goes to FOX TV in Los Angeles 10201 West Pico Blvd. LA CA 90035 care of Party of Five I would love to hear from you!</DD>

         <DT><STRONG>Question</STRONG></DT>
