         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Oh man. Now I remember, you wanted to be a singer, originally right?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>When I was little, yeah, my sister and I&#151;</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>But little was like, five years ago.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Well, still, you know, we would sing with hairbrushes as our mike in front of our mirror, and that was sort of what I wanted to do.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Yeah but you did&#151;you were in some contest things, right?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Yeah, yeah I was on Star Search, a junior vocalist.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>You were on Star Search. Now how old were you?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>I was eight.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Eight years old. Now is that embarrassing? It was good then&#151;</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Well, yeah, it was fun then, but now it's really embarrassing.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>You know it's funny because, you know, Ed MacMahon is a good friend of mine. And I said, &quot;Oh, you know, Lacey&#151;Lacey is coming on the show.&quot; And just&#151;see, this is what you looked like when I met you. This&#151;when I look at this today, this is the greatest piece of tape I have ever seen.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Oh my gosh!</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>No, this is the greatest. I love this piece of tape. This is going into my anniversary reel. Now show us&#151;here's Lacey on Star Search.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>[Sings &quot;Happy Days Are Here Again&quot;]</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Oh, it's the greatest! That's great!</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>What was I thinking?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>I love the big tooth. [Imitating Lacey] Happy days are here. It's great. It's cute. It's wonderful. It's the greatest thing I've ever seen. Now, how's Party of Five going? This show's like&#151;because when you were here, the show was sort of struggling along, and a few people were watching, and it got great critic reviews. But not, not&#151;</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Yeah, but we're almost through with our&#151;</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Not many viewers. Now it's got huge viewers&#151;</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Yeah, but we're almost through with our fourth year.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Wow.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Another sad year. Yeah, Claudia is me. Her parents died. Her brother was diagnosed with cancer, and almost died. Her other brother is alcoholic. She's missing school, so now she's seeing a psychiatrist from depression. So, life's been good.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Now, the last time you were here, as I remember, I remember you had a huge crush on that, uh, Scott Wolf guy. Was he engaged to Alyssa Milano?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>He was. Yes.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Did he break your heart?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Well, I had a huge crush on him, and I thought you know, that he would like, marry me. And then, you know, he gets a girlfriend, and I was totally crushed. But now we're like really best friends, and he's like my brother, so&#151;</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Oh okay. Well that's&#151;now, do you have a boy&#151;you're fifteen, I guess you can have a boyfriend, I guess.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>I did. Yeah, I had my first boyfriend, actually&#151;</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Oh, yeah?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Actually, when I was filming Lost in Space in London.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>You met a foreign guy? Stay away from those foreign guys&#151;</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>No, no. He's not a foreigner. He's actually&#151;he lives in New York.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>You know, they carry disease, those foreign guys.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>[Laughs]</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>I'm very protective of you because you're my little&#151;guest here. Really, so you met a guy and he was in the movie?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>No, he wasn't in the movie, but he was kin to someone in the movie, and I had my first kiss.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Oh, first kiss? Oh, that's okay. That's good. With, with adult supervision around.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>No, it was just him. It was outside of my flat in London. Actually, at my apartment. It was the last time I was going to see him. And I thought, you know, maybe he'd want to kiss me or whatever. So, I felt like I was going to throw up. And&#151;and he just looks at me and says, &quot;Kiss me?&quot; And we kissed. And it was perfect. We couldn't have wrote it better.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>And then he went home. And then he left.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Right. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Now, have you been writing. Have you been corresponding with this guy?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Um, that's kind of weird.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Yeah. He doesn't know how to write?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Um, no. No, no, no&#151;</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>How young is this guy?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>No, he's my age. We talked and let's just say we're now more friends. Something happened and I still haven't figured it out. I don't know</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Well, okay. Well, that'll happen. You're fifteen; you've got the rest of your life. That's okay. Now tell us about Lost in Space. Obviously, this is based on the famous TV show, right?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Mmm hmm.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>From the sixties. Now, now, your character, I'm trying to&#151;</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>I play Penny.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Penny. [Laughs]</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Yes, Penny Robinson, space captive. She's like totally against going on the mission at all. She's this rebel.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Oh okay. Now we have a clip here from the movie?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>I think so.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>All right, here, let's take a look. Here's a scene from Lost in Space.</DD>
         <P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>[Clip Plays]</STRONG></P>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>So tell me, how&#151;was it fun filming this movie?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Oh, it was so much fun. You know, it's like&#151;it was very challenging. You had to wear all these weird costumes, and these like skin-tight latex costumes. The same people made the Batman costumes.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Oh okay.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>I had a body cast made before I went over there.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>A body ca&#151;now why, why, why is&#151;</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>So they could have my body in London to make the costume.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Oh, I see.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>And I had to stand there with my arms out, you know, and they were wrapping me for like two and a half hours, and then they get to my face, and obviously I didn't know it then but I was very claustrophobic. So I thought, ugh, I can't take this, I'm about to throw up, and so I&#151;</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Did they wrap your face?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Yes! And you know I was like trying to stick my tongue through the mold with the mold like telling them, &quot;Okay quit, I'm about to, you know, faint.&quot; And they're like, &quot;Oh, I think she wants a picture. I think she wants a picture. Let's take a picture.&quot; And they're offering me, &quot;Would you like some tea? Would you like milk with your tea?&quot; And I'm trying, mmm mmm, trying to say something. And finally my mom came and ripped it off because she thought, you know, obviously something was wrong. And I, like, collapsed.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Well, there you go, so&#151;</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>It wasn't the best, but it was very fun.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Now did you like Europe? Was it fun?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Oh, it was so much fun. The best, the best shopping.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Yeah.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>You know, I got kicked out at Harrods.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>You got kicked out for what?</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Yeah, you know Harrods; it's like this department store landmark. I was in there and I was wearing, you know, like cutoff shorts and a nice a T-shirt. And they come over, &quot;Excuse me, missy, you're dressed inappropriately. You have to be escorted out of the building.&quot;</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Wow.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>And they take me to a sign and there's like this, you know, little person wearing shorts with a big &quot;X&quot; through it and they made me leave!</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Aww. There you go. Well there you go. Well listen, it's good to see you again. And it's good to see you all grown up. You're doing great. Congratulations.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Thank you.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>We should play our tape again, but we don't have time.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Lacey Chabert</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>Thank you.</DD>
         <DT><STRONG>Jay Leno</STRONG></DT>
         <DD>We'll be right back with, uh, Jimmy Ray. Stay away from these musician guys.</DD>
